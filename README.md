# Cinematherapy 🎬💊
#### Video Demo: https://youtu.be/0GDD8uqfqs8

#### Description:

**Cinematherapy** is a Flask-based web app that prescribes movies based on your mood — wrapped in the aesthetic and interactivity of a quirky therapist, Dr. Ahmed.

Whether you’re feeling **sad**, **angry**, **burnt out**, **in love**, or **anxious**, Cinematherapy offers a visually engaging “prescription” of films to match your mental state. You can keep clicking “Get Another Prescription” to receive fresh randomized sets of films every time — powered by a pool of over **140 hand-picked movie recommendations** across seven moods, each with poster images and thoughtful notes.

### 🧠 Features:

- 7 moods, 20+ movies each
- Mood-specific themes (colors, animations)
- Dark mode toggle (site-wide)
- "Dr. Ahmed" advice quotes styled like a chat bubble
- Endless random movie generation with every click

### 🔍 Design Choices:

- **Wikipedia image links** were used for reliability after issues with Imgur links.
- **JavaScript interactivity** added for theme toggles and prescription refresh.
- We avoided user login to keep the app therapeutic, fast, and anonymous — just like real therapy often starts.
- Used `random.sample()` for dynamic movie rotation on each button click.
